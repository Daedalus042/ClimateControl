# Climate Controls

Take control of your climate!

## About

This project is for creating a more robust climate control for my apartment. This extends to gathering the current temperature of the apartment using a temperature sensor, using that measurment to determine the AC unit's actions, and set a routine (or more) for the AC unit to follow.

## Capabilities

### Currently Supported

- Imitate controls of the fan remote
- Imitate controls of the AC remote
- Collect temperature data from local sensor
- Fetch epoch from NTP server

### Future Support

- Transmit temperature to AC unit
- Create scheduals
- Create away routines
- Create high/low cutoffs for fan/AC units
